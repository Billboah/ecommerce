## ☁️ AWS Cloud Deployment Workflow

This project is not just a frontend — it’s a **mini DevOps project** deployed using AWS best practices:

- 🔐 **Private S3 bucket** (no public access)
- 🌐 **CloudFront CDN** for fast global delivery
- 📦 **GitHub Actions CI/CD** – Auto-deploys on every push to `main`
- 🚫 **CloudFront Invalidation** – Ensures users always get the latest version
- 📄 **Static Site Export** – `next export` used for S3-optimized output
- 🧠 **Best Practices Followed:** Origin Access Control (OAC), bucket policy restrictions, HTTPS delivery, and custom caching
